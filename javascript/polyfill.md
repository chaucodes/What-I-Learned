# Polyfill

I always head the term *polyfill* get thrown around but I never knew what it meant. Finally looked it up today and it makes total sense. 

Essentially what a polyfill is, is it's a piece of code that allows for modern functionality to be compatible with older browers that don't support it. (IE7 RIP).
